 # My Personal Customizations and info about the Conventions that will be used in this repo
 
 ## Problems categorized on importance
 
 I categorize my problems based on the difficulty level or importance that will be essential for anyone to go through, when needed. Like,
 "Day--------imp" -> Here imp means important.
 "Day--------Nimp" -> Here Nimp means Not important.
 "Day--------Norm" -> Here Norm means Normal.
 
 ## Solutions
 I write solutions of the different problems of the leetcode on the daily basis, which are purely in C++ Programming language.
 
 ## Why C++?
 
 C++ teaches you how to be a real, raw problem solver.
 C++ is considered the best choice for competitive programming by the 75% of the programmers accross the world.
